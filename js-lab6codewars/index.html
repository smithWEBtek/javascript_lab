	<ul>
		<li>The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks ([0,2,7,0]). </li>
		<li>The third bank has the most blocks (7), so it is chosen for redistribution.</li>
		<li>Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing one block at a time, the 7 blocks are spread out over
			the memory banks. </li>
		<li>The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. </li>
		<li>The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.</li>
		<li>Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). </li>
		<li>Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. </li>
		<li>The result is: 3 1 2 3.</li>
		<li>Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. </li>
		<li>The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none:
			0 2 3 4.</li>
		<li>The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.</li>
		<li>The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2. </li>
		<li>At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. </li>
		<li>The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.
